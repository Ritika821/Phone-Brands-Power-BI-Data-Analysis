# Phone-Brands-Power-BI-Data-Analysis


## Introduction :

This is a Power BI project in which I have analysed and compared the price and ratings of different brands of the phone. In this dataset we have total 51 brands of phones with their competitive average price and ratings. In this there are some phones and some are handsets also but I have taken these two under the phone category only. In this competitive world there are lots of product with different brands available in the market. Its difficult for us to choose one with reasonable price and features as we are attracted by various real or artificial fascinating advertisements. But its difficult for us to believe on these advertisements that's why we find ratings every where in order to know the best product brand in the market. So this dashboard may help you to choose the best mobile brand with the features suits your personality. Lets get more details about the dashboard.
